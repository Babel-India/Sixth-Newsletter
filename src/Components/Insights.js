            <div className='poem'>
               <p className='poem-line'>Nowadays, we often observe that gaming has been labelled as a waste of time and money by many. So there must be some strong reason behind such labelling. Parents of online gamers call it a waste of time for the fact that their kids have become anti-social and more addicted towards digital sources. No one can deny this fact that technology has created certain gaps but solemnly blaming games wouldn't satiate the real reason of such categorisation.
                </p>
               <p className='poem-line'>We do notice people mindlessly scrolling their instagram pages, chatting on apps, watching web series and movies and many other activities are done on phone so playing games is also a part of this digital world.Everything has its pros and cons and creating balance between them nullifies the situation.Games started in the arcades as a popular place for both kids and adults to hang out.When these games transitioned into the home, they captured even more attention. Time spent playing games comes with a lot of negativity from those on the outside looking in.Games provides sense of relaxation and entertainment because theyâ€™re interactive and it lets the players become part of the story.Games either challenges the mind or dexterity of the player, but even if a game is not listed as an educational type of game, it can teach a variety of skills. It lessens boredom and increases alertness of the mind. There are jobs that pay people to play games and test them for glitches, overall gameplay, story experience, etc.
                </p>
               <p className='poem-line'>It can be concluded that nothing that is done for fun should be considered as a waste of time because it unknowingly teaches us a lot. It is always said that anything done in balance never becomes a hindrance.
