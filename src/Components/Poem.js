            <p className='poem-line'>Pressing Play-Doh on the Sunday strips
            Baseball cards going click,click, click
            Making the Etch-A Sketch screen all black
            Spinning on the pointy end, a six prolonged jack
            <br/>
            A Slinky going down the stairs
            Naked trolls with coloured hairs
            Strings on fingers form cup and saucer
            Skipping rocks across the water
            <br/>
            Looking for a four leafed clover
            Red Rover, Red Rover send Jenny over
            Hide and seek or kick the can
            Crack the whip holding hand in hand
            <br/>
            Down in the valley where green grass grows
            Lining up dominoâ€™s in fall down row
            Hop scotch squares on the front sidewalk 
            Graffiti drawn in coloured chalk
            <br/>
            Bubbles blown from soap
            Skipping, in tandem, the jumping rope
            Mud pies after a fallen rain
            A childhood lost, but memories gained
            <br/>
